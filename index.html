    <h1>The Chains We Don’t See</h1>
    <h4>By Austin Towns</h4>
    <p>Lately I've been trying to cage my mind to the present. But it seems like if my mind wanders free it always finds itself in the past.</p>
    <p>My last girlfriend used to call me a loser to show her affection. As if she was trying to apologize or seem like she understood a plight. Being black. Being a loser. Somehow these two concepts were intertwined. Like I was a loser the moment I was born into this world with dark skin. Disadvantaged. Behind. It was not a choice. It was a birthright.</p>
    <p>Entire generations of brothers sisters mothers fathers sons daughters forced into mental illness in the fields and the houses. Uncles become fathers. Grandmothers forced to rear a child again with their outdated knowledge about the world. How much learning the father didn’t pass down to his son or daughter because he was displaced on another plantation or he died in the streets of South Central Los Angeles or he martyred himself in his office, day in day out, because he believed his co-workers were light years ahead of him, because he believed he had this chronic illness called being black in America.</p>
    <p>Not just driving, living. Living while black is a state of perpetual anxiety. Wondering how one day I’ll have to explain to my children that they were born into this world with a blessing and a curse. Explain to them that they will be subjugated to a racism I probably won't understand, because it is a racism so subtle, the only indicator of its existence will be in the tears from my children's faces.</p>
    <p>And now I look up. And I walk. And I live. A young black man trying to find his way. And I ask myself when the day will come when I will see past racism, depression, and self-pity. I ask myself when I will step into God's glory and see that this skin, this struggle is a blessing. This melanin is a cure. This life is a happy one.</p>

    <h1>Diaspora Daughter Blues</h1>
    <h4>By Muna Mohamed</h4>
    <p>my first bad word was <span class="italic">ceeb</span>. it means private. ceeb was the response to every time my body would talk. ceeb was my body. my body was my first bad word. ceeb is the only way i know how to talk to my body. i hold my body in private, and ceeb is what happens when i try to break out.  </p>
    <p>ceeb is a jail cell that parts of me have always been locked in. i entered this cell at age 9, when i first realized my body was different. a woman is a joke, and her body is the punchline. i remember the first joke made about my body. my mother looked over at my aunt, and asked, have we checked her halaalays recently? halal is the word they use to describe what is permissible, like meat. they chuckled, a laughter drenched in pain, or conformity. i can’t tell the difference. when they cut parts of me i became halal. became permissible. became every man’s dream. did you know that you are a fantasy? how dare we leave you open?  </p>
    <p>it’s funny - how my body became a public matter the day they called me gabar. how they make you think your body was born in private. a secret. it’s no wonder we’ve always been good at keeping those. my body is a secret i keep in private.</p>
    <p>back home is the place i am most insecure. when i went back home, i learned to be private. when i was 9, i learned my first secret. when they ask me where i’m from, i don’t know what to say. back home, they don’t talk about this, back home they don’t talk, back home, you are taught to fear yourself, to look in the mirror and never see enough. girls here cut school to go on vacation. but we go on vacation to get cut. to some, woman means meat. and what is a man but a butcher? patriarchy but a warehouse? and love something i search for in every man’s chest.</p>
    <p>my home country cut me, and now, hurt is my mother tongue.</p>
    <p>i call this diaspora daughter blues, a girl simply looking for a place to call home. a place that will hold her, caress her, kiss her on the cheek, tell her she is whole, even if parts of her are missing. a place that will tell her the truth, what happened to her, who did this to her, and why.</p>
    <p>ceeb: somali word meaning private, usually in reference to woman’s body parts, sex, etc.</p>
    <p>gabar: somali word meaning girl</p>

    <h1>Seja Meu Refugio</h1>
    <h4>By Rosa Stern Pait</h4>
    <h6 class="bold">Seja meu refugio</h6>
    <p>
      deixa-me fugir por barco<br />
      de baixo das nuvens<br />
      para longe, pela chuva<br />
      bebendo agua salgada<br />
      que vem morna do fundo do mar<br />
      ai, minha rocha no vento<br />
      seus braços a praia em que me jogo<br />
      o mar ardendo, a areia grudando<br />
      prendendo-me as pernas em cauda<br />
      meus cabelos algas marinhas coladas em minhas costas<br />
      meus dedos segurando firme, suplicantes<br />
      os peixes fortes atras<br />
      as luzes, a névoa em frente<br />
      esconde-me, abraça-me com sua voz<br />
      vamos ouvir uma onda atrás da outra<br />
      até que você me devolve, ofegante, para o mar<br />
    </p>
    <h6 class="bold">Be my refuge</h6>
    <p>
      let me escape by boat<br />
      under the clouds<br />
      to somewhere far, through the rain<br />
      drinking saltwater<br />
      that comes up warm from the bottom of the sea oh, my rock in the wind<br />
      i throw myself onto the beach, into your arms the stinging sea, the sticking sand<br />
      binding my legs into a tail<br />
      my hair seaweed clinging to my back<br />
      my fingers holding tight, supplicants<br />
      the strong fish behind me<br />
      the lights, the mist in front<br />
      hide me, hold me with your voice<br />
      let’s listen to one wave a after another<br />
      until you throw me back, gasping, to the sea<br />

    <h1>EXCEPTIONS FOR THE SAFETY OF INDIAN WOMEN</h1>
    <h5>By Carissa Fleury</h5>
    <p>In the following, I have attempted to produce work in the tradition of both M. NourbeSe Philip and Layli Long Solider by interacting with the Violence Against Women Act, specifically Section IX, titled “Safety for Indian Women.” From this, I have created poetry using only the words that are found within this section of the document. No words of my own have been added</p>
    <p>
      in united states code<br />
      the term victim means:<br />
      alleged<br />
      criminal<br />
      not protected
    </p>
    <p>
      in united states code<br />
      a victim shall only be affirmed if:
    </p>
    <p>
      (i) violence occurs in the indian country<br />
      (the term indian means something)
    </p>
    <p>
      (ii) is employed in the indian country<br />
      (threatening acts<br />
      harassment<br />
      sexual violence<br />
      permitted)
    </p>
    <p>
      (iii) is the spouse, intimate<br />
      partner or dating partner of<br />
      someone systematically excluded<br />
      from the protection of the united states
    </p>
    <p>
      under the impartial constitution of<br />
      the united states<br />

      domestic violence<br />
      sexual violence
    </p>
    <p>
      violation<br />
      against indian women are<br />
      consistent<br />
      recognized and<br />
      affirmed
    </p>
    <p>
      these previous exclusions<br />
      are necessary to exercise special<br />
      domestic violence against<br />
      the indian and<br />
      protect the defendant<br />
      from<br />
      imprisonment
    </p>
    <p>
      subsequent questions employed<br />
      by the participating tribe shall<br />
      result in enforceable violence<br />
      against them by<br />
      congress

    <h1>A Tendency to Ask</h1>
    <h2>By Ethan Laurence Resik</h2>
    <p>You find yourself between a bus seat<br />and a therapist&rsquo;s couch.<br />A chameleon of both surfaces,<br />you find a universality in<br />providing imitations of what you see:</p>
    <p>mirrored photographs of Narcissus.<br />This is a bad night<br />of your own prismed creation.<br />Passersby call it completely normal.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Through the smoke and incense, a dullness<br />vibrates. Your warm-blooded body pulses from<br />heart to tapping feet; he speaks to you,<br />&ldquo;you know, I didn&rsquo;t really get it but I still love it.&rdquo;<br />Wishing you got it, you smile. Such a true smile.</p>
    <p>Yet you fear a good night for what<br />proceeds. Every human knows that feeling,<br />I think. You walk from the stairs, outside,<br />and look up. You see the uncontrollable<br />starlight reflect on your chest.<br />Footsteps approach somewhere nearby.</p>

    <h1>Reinvent</h1>
    <h2>By Emmett Pinsky</h2>
    <p>because of their physical state, it might seem wrong to speak of cracking open clouds.<br />vapor is not brittle but it has come to my attention that<br />even sweetness does not preclude the eventuality of this nasty type of snap.</p>
    <p>ever-wondering my metadiegetic status as an object in your world.<br />how much narrative importance do I get?<br />someone said this, once:<br /><span style="padding-left: 60px;">&ldquo;one slow-motion sequence of fluttering birds in a slow-motion film makes for a potent</span><br /><span style="padding-left: 60px;">metadiegetic signifier; one hundred slow-motion sequences of fluttering birds makes for a nature documentary.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p>i might be so boring as to say:<br /><span style="padding-left: 60px;">i do my best writing in airports.</span></p>
    <p>now that the clouds have cracked open, our hands have become tools<br />in the way we have been told they once were, before we invented <br /><span style="padding-left: 60px;">shoplifting, fonts, I.O.U.s, mothers, montages, bookmarks, breakables, screenshots,</span><br /><span style="padding-left: 60px;">and therapy.</span></p>
    <p>don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel, they say.<br />but if there is joy in the invention?<br />cycles of creation give life give light!<br />please please please do not fault me for tilting my head toward that ceaseless becoming.</p>
    <p>perhaps that is why Carson called them the Cycladic people.<br />inventing and reinventing the purse, grindstones, and insomnia.</p>
    <p>long ago, they told us, our hands were tools<br />and with them we clapped and scratched and held.</p>
    <p>the clouds cracked open and we dropped to the ground, hands doing exactly what they are supposed to<br />(catching us as we land, land.)</p>
    <p>we are left alone with only our hands to gather the time that has been so spoiled.<br />eventually we will invent the Jar, which holds time better than hands,<br />then the shelf, which holds jars better than sand.</p>
    <p>given its physical state, it might seem wrong to speak of time reflecting light<br />but given recent events i feel confident in saying that<br />the best clocks speak through sun<br />and look over shoulders toward<br />some other becoming</p>

    <p>we are quiet, we shiver for the sun<br />has not yet warmed the sunken air<br />plumes are expelled from between lips or nostrils<br />with hands shoved deep deep<br />into the confidence of pockets<br />we march on</p>
    <p>II. the clouds</p>
    <p>a fog closes in on us from all sides<br />and it feels like the only thing<br />here<br />is our little stretch of road<br />beneath a big blue bus</p>
    <p>III. the self</p>
    <p>I am so many patterns of blue<br />the sky wraps around my ankles and<br />tucks into my rubber boots<br />a speckled umbrella swings<br />from two fingers by my knees<br />the rain tickles the tops of my cheeks</p>
    <p>I am safe in oversized plaid rolled<br />to the elbows and the leaves<br />look up as I pass, splayed<br />on their backs<br />upon pooling wrinkled pavement</p>
    <p>I forget where I am going</p>

    <h1>Retail</h1>
    <h2>By Priyanka Padidam</h2>
    <p>Before the storm I&rsquo;m staticked in the canned foods aisle, wondering if Cheez Whiz is actually good when a man reminds me that men can see me. I don&rsquo;t buy it.</p>
    <p>That winter was half intake forms and half nodding to advice from wayward older women like,<br />70% of your body should be vegetables. Everything in or on your body should probably be brand<br />name. Except for pregnancy tests, those don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
    <p>Sunday finds me couch-crusted in front of a dude in a docuseries on the 1980s saying<br />Life was good! There were products to buy!</p>
    <p>You know some people in El Paso go to Mexican pharmacies just to ask for over-the-counter birth control. Bordered, they cross and buy it.</p>
    <p>Tonight: a train-dream turned plane-crash. The metal pill hardwares towards the ground and a stranger turns to me and smiles because it&rsquo;s the last thing to give.</p>

    <h1>Old Joke</h1>
    <h2>By Megan Mooney</h2>
    <p>I can&rsquo;t get it out of my head, the Doritos truck<br />behind the hearse, not part of any procession, but still. God</p>
    <p>I am sorry for laughing at that, this too:<br />the woman taking photos of the open casket at</p>
    <p>my distant uncle&rsquo;s too early funeral while my grandma<br />by proxy tries to set me up with a third cousin&mdash;</p>
    <p>he&rsquo;s so handsome, you know, and smart and you two<br />would just hit it off&mdash;and right then I could have died</p>
    <p>of embarrassment. at Queer<br /><span style="padding-left: 200px;">death, my relatives</span><br />sad react to Newtown not Orlando. The little cousins sharing</p>
    <p>repost if you hate cancer, 88% of you won&rsquo;t follow<br />that old joke: only the bagpiper rejoices at the death</p>
    <p>of a firefighter, in his best kilt on the rotary<br />during rush hour. the widow&rsquo;s grief thinly veiled</p>
    <p>driving home, I hear that mournful wail but my god<br />you wouldn&rsquo;t believe the traffic</p>
