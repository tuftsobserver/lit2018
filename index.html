      <h1>Letter from the Editors</h1>
      <p id="leditor-1">Welcome to the Observer&rsquo;s Literary Issue. This spring, it is our pleasure to bring you 22 pieces of poetry &amp; prose from the Tufts community.</p>
      <p id="leditor-2">These pieces are about home, family, linguistics, knitting, sports, translation, birth, religion, and land. They are phone calls to a friend. They write across the lines of what is legal and not legal. They lay bare events and experiences that often go undocumented. Richard White writes, &ldquo;there are regions of the past that only memory knows,&rdquo; and these poems are maps of those regions.</p>
      <p>Why do we devote an entire issue to poetry and prose? The work inside these pages does what the Observer does in every issue. These pieces are news, opinions, arts, campus life, and personal narratives.</p>
      <p>There are things that are easy to say in essays or in articles or behind podiums&mdash;charismatic arguments, slogans, and sweeping claims about the state of the ____. These poems contain truths that do not fit neatly into a single slogan or claim. They hold multiple voices and ideas at once, often in the same line or word.</p>
      <p>We love these pieces because they expose the quotidian that lives within the stories that end up on the news or in our class readings. They are about what it feels like to live inside history, when looking back means looking around, forward and away.</p>
      <p>These writers take the world&mdash;its snack foods, its canyons and tourist-filled beaches, its terrifying histories&mdash;and rearrange it to show us the possibilities of what this world can be, or maybe already is. We are grateful to the writers for giving us their words. Thank you for giving us the specific joy of making this year&rsquo;s Literary Issue.</p>

    <h1>Ruth</h1>
    <h4>By Elana DeSantis</h4>
    <div class="ruth-text">
      <p>May I remember your hands as hands. <br />
        Not as a genesis of melodies that spill from stringed, wooden things, <br />Not as a gold-sifting plate on the riverbed from horse-drawn journeys to a Great Red West, <br />
      Not as some basin for holy water from which I no longer drink.</p>
      <p>May I see you as a breathing, pulsing thing: <br />She who squeezes her eyes shut as she sings, <br />She who covers cucumbers slices and tomato pulp in sea salt, <br />She who wrote me letters pressed under her t shirt in a yellow lunchbox that says &ldquo;St. Louis,&rdquo; <br />She who I loved in the way that I loved her.</p>
      <p>May you never become a myth that grows so big inside of me <br />that I must break you into paragraphs <br />to stomach our memory. </p>

    <p class="right">Even if I got it to honor your memory</p><br>

    <p class="right">Because I fear what the response would be</p><br>
    <p>Yo, tu nieta, a quien a veces también le gustan otras mujeres</p><br>
    <p class="right">Doesn’t know what I’m doing, where I’m going, or how to heal in the right places</p><br>
    <p>¿Cómo puedo aprender a amar las partes de mí misma que creo que solo odiarías?</p><br>
    <p class="right">How do I learn to love the parts of myself I think you would only hate?</p><br>
    <p class="right">You can tell me I shouldn’t think about it like that</p><br>
    <p>Pero tengo el ejemplo de su hijo</p><br>
    <p>Quien a veces ni siquiera puede mirarme a los ojos</p><br>
    <p class="right">With my tattoos and piercings and buzzcut</p><br>
    <p class="right">Abuelita asked me if I had gotten gum stuck in it</p><br>
    <p>“¿Por eso te lo cortaste de esa manera?”</p><br>
    <p>Le respondí que solo era por mi gusto</p><br>
    <p class="italic">Mi gusto es...</p><br>
    <p class="right">I can’t hear that song without thinking of you.</p><br><br>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <p>Pero lo que a veces me dejo pensar</p><br>
    <p class="right">Is that in spite of all this</p><br>
    <p class="right">You would still love me</p><br>
    <p class="right">You would still care for me</p><br>
    <p class="right">You would still defend me</p><br>
    <p>Y aunque no sepa tus respuestas</p><br>
    <p class="right">I still love you</p><br>
    <p class="right">I still care for you</p><br>

    <h1>Place of birth</h1>
    <h1>No. Mariana Is., U.S.A.</h1>
    <h4>By May Hong</h4>

    <p>The Mariana Trench is the deepest region of all the world’s oceans. Wikipedia says it’s “a crescent-shaped scar in the Earth's crust.” The last trickle of sunlight disappears about a tenth of the way down, the rest is total darkness. Only two manned descents have ever been made to Challenger Deep, one of which was by James Cameron, who described the floor to be “very lunar.”</p>
    <p>In sixth grade art class, we learned how to carve linoleum blocks for printing. The teacher said to carve away from ourselves, but I still nicked my fingers so many times that she ended up just placing a box of Band-Aids next to my station. Wikipedia says a gouge is a chisel “in which the blade is curved along its length, to allow working in a hollow not otherwise accessible with a straight blade.” Making all these little u-shaped dents of investigation.</p>
    <p>My passport assigns “No. Mariana Is., U.S.A.” as my place of birth. I listed Saipan as my hometown on Facebook, though I left before I learned to speak. It’s pretty hard to spot on most maps. At the northern tip of the island is a place called Suicide Cliff, where an estimated 8,000 Japanese soldiers and civilians collectively leapt to their deaths in the face of imminent capture by the Americans, demonstrating unwavering allegiance to their Great Empire.

  	<p>Clicking through census records on ancestry.com. I imagine<br/>
		us sitting under a tree with red leaves. You [maiden name Zudek] are my great<br/>
		great grandmother migrated to the United States [the federal census suggests<br/>
	</p>
	<p>the year 1871] and a few years later founded the Jewish<br/>
		Women’s Association in Providence [Rhode Island Tax Archive] you<br/>
		married Levi Jersky [see the mid 1900’s my grandfather changed<br/>
		his last name from Jersky to Jaye] in Russia [based on marriage records<br/>
	</p>
	<p>the union occurred six years before migrating to the united states]. I grew<br/>
		up hearing stories about my grandfather’s factory like hard<br/>
		work and the sound of trumpets and leader in the community and good<br/>
		at math and overcoming and every other phrase connoting self-made<br/>
	</p>
	<p>man and the American dream. So I peer at you intently between the film<br/>
		of the leaves of our family tree. I can’t see you. I just see movies<br/>
		of poor women with dark curly hair and stinky fish<br/>
		in New York City hanging laundry between tenement houses. But you lived<br/>
	</p>
	<p>in Providence. Maybe you hated fish. Maybe you hated laundry or played basketball. I<br/>
		want to sit next to you on the neon green couch in my grandma’s house and watch<br/>
		Gilmore Girls. I most want to ask you about the calm<br/>
		before the storm. The storm obviously being a metaphor<br/>
	<p>
	<p>for what happens when</p>
	<p>did it all start. I imagine with<br/>
		a rib. Lilith yells something<br/>
		I can’t make out. A voice<br/>

		red leaves and<br/>
		old names.

    	<p>ever talking about my own? Rise early<br/>

    		up in each other—my hand making faces<br/>

    	</p>
    	<p>need witnesses to conjure you, these rehearsals</p>

    		of your absence. Welcome me home.

  		<h1>7TH INNING STRETCH</h1>
  		<h5>By Jordan Lauf</h5>

  		<p>When you breach the surface, it all comes rushing in at once: the meticulous brown and green borders of the diamond, the heady scent of popcorn and beer, the calls for water and crackerjacks and the echoing chatter. I always bask in the entrance for a minute, taking in air after being underwater for so long.</p>

  		<p>Baseball is a bit like church. The more I learn about it, the less it makes sense. How a person connects bat to blurred ball, how someone else catches that ball. How a pitcher can paint the outside corner just so, as if they were licking a bit of jam off the tip of their upper lip. I think that’s why my love for baseball has always been worshipful, complete, full enough to roll around in my mouth and never dissolve.
  		</p>

  		<p>My father taught me the sacraments. The Cracker-Jack communion, the 9th inning Hail Mary, the ballgame hymns. When we perform these rituals, side by side, we almost look the same. Our actions mirror in a way our conversations never do, the ones that begin at such different angles that the lines never intersect. But when you’re at a baseball game, all that exists in the world is the delicious moment of stillness before a pitcher releases his slider or his curveball. A purposeful silence.</p>

  		<p>But games only last nine innings, or ten, or fourteen, and at the end someone has to win or lose. All religions are like that. And at the end of the game, the traffic and the grit and the sun and talk radio and fathers who don’t know you come flooding back in.</p>

  		<p>She handed me a pair of knitting needles,</p>

  		<p>some blue yarn, across the gap between our chairs. Like a peace offering. I was not of the impression we
      were in need of peace. I liked doing things with my hands (especially during those sessions) and so I,
      quietly, picked up the needles my therapist passed me, the yarn. Blue, and darker blue for the edge. We
      were making hats.</p>

      <p>Knitting followed sand tray. Sand tray followed The Thoughts. The Thoughts had followed...I don’t know
      what exactly. But maybe we can’t remember our history, can’t trace its happenings, the ways it loops back,
      folds over generations and decades and moments and bodies, at 12 years old.</p>

      <p>“You were pretty old,” my mom says in discussions we have now. And “what do you think that was
      about?”</p>

      <p>I don’t know what it was about. Well I do, but not why they came. The Thoughts. They happened slowly, a
      subtle and quiet silky surge. Until suddenly (it felt like) my mind was screaming all the</p>

      <p>time. Thought winds tearing apart the careful, tidy inside I constructed my head to be. (I know now it was
      not of a sudden. I can see the inklings, the building, the rupture in earlier memories, the short gasps, the
      shadows, the cruel dances in my peripheral vision hinting at the main act).</p>

      <p>My mother as a container for the toxicity in my head: I think now of the way we dispose of nuclear waste.
      How we put it in strong (but not impenetrable) vessels. Hope they don’t</p>

      <p>explode. Dump it into the sea. Pray for animals to stay unglowing. I think now of the weight my mother
      carried as I wept my mind into hers. I would call her, when she was far away from me. I would follow
      her around, whispering these destructive nothings in her ear. These nothings (in another mind, might
      they have been truly nothings?) that pulled me away from myself, that festered within me until I was so
      infected I thought I would burst. Talking to my mother as draining my own wound. Gauze arms seeping
      up my oozing.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>We cast on. Perhaps 45 stitches. I don’t remember now; the patterns have faded into faintness. [knit 2
      purl 2, knit 2 purl 2] I wondered if this is what everyone’s therapy sessions were like. Playing in sandboxes
      with small figurines. Crafting. I buried my answers in my loops of yarn, tucking them away so they didn’t
      escape to torment me. “I don’t knows” and “I do knows” found their way into blue and blue fibers, weaving
      something to keep me warm. In 50 minute chunks. “That’s our time” coming before answers. Weaving
      terminated. Venture forth into the cold with hat unfinished.</p>

      <p>Venture forth to my mother as a tree, absorbing the putrid mindmatter I fed to her, filtering, offering
      oxygen, release from the choking. Rings of scars and stories. The lean years and bountiful marked on her
      mind/body. Traces of salty grief in her acorns. My mother as breath. As nourishment.</p>

      <p>My mother cleaned out the closet of my room at home recently. She tells me that she threw out a lot of
      my old ballet stuff, saving only a pair of pointe shoes, a leotard. I wonder if she saw the half-finished hat
      in my basket of tangled yarn. If I’ve forgotten that I’ve already unraveled it. If maybe I turned that blue
      into another creation.</p>

    <h1>An Ode to Tropical Sno</h1>
    <h4>By Ailie Orzak</h4>
    <div class="inner-text">
      <p>I swore I would never return, yet there I was, beginning summer just like the last: turquoise walls, a neon yellow t-shirt, rainbow bottles. Kid-friendly hues spilled across the floor until they dripped down, down to the underneath and that&rsquo;s where I saw it &mdash; a hidden ugly, dust and mold and shoes sticking on the melt. Blue walls pressed in on me so I could no longer breathe, and my throat closed around vials of sugary syrup, choking on the overly sweet promise of new things to come.</p>
      <p>And the snow cones weren&rsquo;t as sweet as they were the summer before. They coated my teeth and tongue, twisted my stomach with their fake flavor. So I didn&rsquo;t eat them. I didn&rsquo;t eat anything, really.</p>
      <p>At first the shop filled with sound. My friends brightened the colors with their company and laughed with me during work&rsquo;s in-betweens. He was there too, crowding the window bench with them till closing time when we would head out into the summer evening that was made for us &mdash; because this was the beginning of the end and we weren&rsquo;t ready to let go of our world, hanging on to every last bite of our snow cones.</p>
      <p>And things were good. But I still didn&rsquo;t eat the cones, and my throat still closed.</p>
      <p>The season went on and I began to hide alone in the shop until it went so quiet that the colors consumed me as I stepped on sugar spills, sneakers sticking on the syrup that smeared the floor. Outside of work, I still owned the nights with my friends. We would run towards the ends of our small town and beyond to the city where we bought snow cones from somewhere else, laughing at how much better they were as we sat on the edge of the Lake Michigan and watched the skyline glow. Yet even in those brighter moments, I was still stuck and slipping and unable to stop the ugly of the store from seeping in through my shoes. So I didn&rsquo;t let him come around much anymore. I didn&rsquo;t want him to see me dissolving.</p>
      <p>The summer expired, breaking down into even more dust and mold while the shop walls pressed in tighter around me till the night he and I left the store for the last time. For the next few shifts my only hope was that the customers couldn&rsquo;t tell that in my eyes, the blues and the yellows and the rainbows of the shop were a blur that liquidized and leaked down my cheeks, filling up my throat so that it tightened more than ever in order to keep myself from spilling over.</p>
      <p>But through it all, in they came. Friends filed in to grab my syrup-stained hands and pull me from the underneath. We danced together while the final drops of the summer&rsquo;s cones melted, covering every inch of our town as we melted too, dripping up, up, and away along with our world.</p>
      <p>And so the summer departed, whisking me away with it. Miles from that store, it took many months for me to learn to eat again and much longer for my throat to loosen wide enough to let the present and future in. I&rsquo;ve pushed the shop far away from me, yet the summer&rsquo;s sugary traces still linger, the final remnants sticking to my skin.</p>
      <p>Even now, I&rsquo;m slowly scrubbing the last bits of syrup from my fingers.</p>

    <h1>The Chains We Don’t See</h1>
    <div id="chains-content">
      <h5 class="italic">By Austin Towns</h5>
      <p>Lately I've been trying to cage my mind to the present. But it seems like if my mind wanders free it always finds itself in the past.</p>
      <p>My last girlfriend used to call me a loser to show her affection. As if she was trying to apologize or seem like she understood a plight. Being black. Being a loser. Somehow these two concepts were intertwined. Like I was a loser the moment I was born into this world with dark skin. Disadvantaged. Behind. It was not a choice. It was a birthright.</p>
      <p>Entire generations of brothers sisters mothers fathers sons daughters forced into mental illness in the fields and the houses. Uncles become fathers. Grandmothers forced to rear a child again with their outdated knowledge about the world. How much learning the father didn’t pass down to his son or daughter because he was displaced on another plantation or he died in the streets of South Central Los Angeles or he martyred himself in his office, day in day out, because he believed his co-workers were light years ahead of him, because he believed he had this chronic illness called being black in America.</p>
      <p>Not just driving, living. Living while black is a state of perpetual anxiety. Wondering how one day I’ll have to explain to my children that they were born into this world with a blessing and a curse. Explain to them that they will be subjugated to a racism I probably won't understand, because it is a racism so subtle, the only indicator of its existence will be in the tears from my children's faces.</p>
      <p>And now I look up. And I walk. And I live. A young black man trying to find his way. And I ask myself when the day will come when I will see past racism, depression, and self-pity. I ask myself when I will step into God's glory and see that this skin, this struggle is a blessing. This melanin is a cure. This life is a happy one.</p>

      <p>my first bad word was <span class="italic">ceeb</span>. it means private. ceeb was the response to every time my body would talk. ceeb was my body. my body was my first bad word. ceeb is the only way i know how to talk to my body. i hold my body in private, and ceeb is what happens when i try to break out.  </p>
      <p>ceeb is a jail cell that parts of me have always been locked in. i entered this cell at age 9, when i first realized my body was different. a woman is a joke, and her body is the punchline. i remember the first joke made about my body. my mother looked over at my aunt, and asked, have we checked her halaalays recently? halal is the word they use to describe what is permissible, like meat. they chuckled, a laughter drenched in pain, or conformity. i can’t tell the difference. when they cut parts of me i became halal. became permissible. became every man’s dream. did you know that you are a fantasy? how dare we leave you open?  </p>
      <p>it’s funny - how my body became a public matter the day they called me gabar. how they make you think your body was born in private. a secret. it’s no wonder we’ve always been good at keeping those. my body is a secret i keep in private.</p>
      <p>back home is the place i am most insecure. when i went back home, i learned to be private. when i was 9, i learned my first secret. when they ask me where i’m from, i don’t know what to say. back home, they don’t talk about this, back home they don’t talk, back home, you are taught to fear yourself, to look in the mirror and never see enough. girls here cut school to go on vacation. but we go on vacation to get cut. to some, woman means meat. and what is a man but a butcher? patriarchy but a warehouse? and love something i search for in every man’s chest.</p>
      <p>my home country cut me, and now, hurt is my mother tongue.</p>
      <p>i call this diaspora daughter blues, a girl simply looking for a place to call home. a place that will hold her, caress her, kiss her on the cheek, tell her she is whole, even if parts of her are missing. a place that will tell her the truth, what happened to her, who did this to her, and why.</p>
      <p>ceeb: somali word meaning private, usually in reference to woman’s body parts, sex, etc.</p>

      <p>In the following, I have attempted to produce work in the tradition of both M. NourbeSe Philip and Layli Long Solider by interacting with the Violence Against Women Act, specifically Section IX, titled “Safety for Indian Women.” From this, I have created poetry using only the words that are found within this section of the document.

        The door was unassuming and unlocked and maybe that’s what drew me in,<br />
        I’m in the balcony, and maybe I’ll sit for a little bit, maybe the act of being in a church and not<br />
        combusting means I’m not all bad, maybe there’s still a chance for rest-<br />
        Or maybe this is my punishment already,<br />
        The sacredness of a space isin the way it carries the weight ofhow I could have been.<br />
        The air is heavier in the chapel and maybe it’s because I feel the eyes of the congregation,<br />
        but no one is here right now, and I came in through the back.
      </p>
      <p>
        The separation of darkness and emptiness is specific to the perception of it and<br />
        the gray is taking its toll on the way that I breathe.<br />
        The buzzing behind my ears makes me ring louder than I want to, be more than I’ve intended.<br />
        Maybe I’m scared to ask for help because they’ll discover I don’t need it,<br />
        that the fear that possesses meis what life is supposed tobe like.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the hope of a springtime is propelling me through the days-<br />
        The sunshine that we’re promised is a buffer I keep close to my heart.<br />
        My skin is doubly thick as protection, making sure nothing too bad can spill out.<br />
        The world is still turning, and the shade from the trees still leaves a cool patch in the grass.<br />
        Sitting down is a shock to the system, a jolt, a reminder of wakefulness in the gentlest way.<br />
        The bumblebees flit from color to color, drawn to vibrancy, persevering.<br />
        They move and dance and pay no mind to the futility, taking their time,<br />
        stopping to smell the flowers.

        I almost got chlamydia from a boy<br />
        who lays out his clothes for the next day<br />
        before he goes to sleep<br />
        The kind of boy who eats fruit sexually<br />
        But only after its been washed<br />
        because the cashier looked dirty<br />
        Right.<br />
        I almost told him that I loved him<br />
        I was so sleepy I thought I was drunk<br />
        "I was so drunk I thought it was you,"<br />
        Right.<br />
        He held me all night<br />
        I was finally the statue he always wanted me to be except<br />
        I would never glisten like marble in the sun<br />
        I would sparkle like Chaco Canyon<br />
        The reddish brown dirt getting darker in the center of my cheeks<br />
        A mirage you couldn’t get over, a color that worried you<br />
        "Are you alright?"<br />
        His voice cracking because<br />
        maybe I wasn’t white.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don’t answer your parents’ call when I’m around<br />
        Because they might hear my skin on the other line<br />
        The heat rising from the ridges of my body might tell them the truth<br />
        Who almost gave chlamydia to who<br />
        Every tear that fell from your eyes cracked the landscape of my heart<br />
        But I wasn’t allowed to cry because of the drought<br />
        So I love you like I got chlamydia<br />
        Almost

          <p>because of their physical state, it might seem wrong to speak of cracking open clouds.<br />vapor is not brittle but it has come to my attention that<br />even sweetness does not preclude the eventuality of this nasty type of snap.</p>
          <p>ever-wondering my metadiegetic status as an object in your world.<br />how much narrative importance do I get?<br />someone said this, once:<br /><span style="padding-left: 60px;">&ldquo;one slow-motion sequence of fluttering birds in a slow-motion film makes for a potent</span><br /><span style="padding-left: 60px;">metadiegetic signifier; one hundred slow-motion sequences of fluttering birds makes for a nature documentary.&rdquo;</span></p>
          <p>i might be so boring as to say:<br /><span style="padding-left: 60px;">i do my best writing in airports.</span></p>
          <p>now that the clouds have cracked open, our hands have become tools<br />in the way we have been told they once were, before we invented <br /><span style="padding-left: 60px;">shoplifting, fonts, I.O.U.s, mothers, montages, bookmarks, breakables, screenshots,</span><br /><span style="padding-left: 60px;">and therapy.</span></p>
          <p>don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel, they say.<br />but if there is joy in the invention?<br />cycles of creation give life give light!<br />please please please do not fault me for tilting my head toward that ceaseless becoming.</p>
          <p>perhaps that is why Carson called them the Cycladic people.<br />inventing and reinventing the purse, grindstones, and insomnia.</p>
          <p>long ago, they told us, our hands were tools<br />and with them we clapped and scratched and held.</p>
          <p>the clouds cracked open and we dropped to the ground, hands doing exactly what they are supposed to<br />(catching us as we land, land.)</p>
          <p>we are left alone with only our hands to gather the time that has been so spoiled.<br />eventually we will invent the Jar, which holds time better than hands,<br />then the shelf, which holds jars better than sand.</p>
          <p>given its physical state, it might seem wrong to speak of time reflecting light<br />but given recent events i feel confident in saying that<br />the best clocks speak through sun<br />and look over shoulders toward<br />some other becoming</p>

      <p>That winter was half intake forms and half nodding to advice from wayward older women like,<br />70% of your body should be vegetables. Everything in or on your body should probably be brand<br />name. Except for pregnancy tests, those don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
      <p>Sunday finds me couch-crusted in front of a dude in a docuseries on the 1980s saying<br />Life was good! There were products to buy!</p>
      <p>You know some people in El Paso go to Mexican pharmacies just to ask for over-the-counter birth control. Bordered, they cross and buy it.</p>
